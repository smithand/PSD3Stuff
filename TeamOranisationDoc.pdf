Roles
The team organization model that we have all agreed upon using is the Scrum development
model. It is an agile software development framework, such that there is only three different
roles in the team, a scrum master, programmer and the product owner. Every member is equal
in the team in terms of authority, each member has work that they are able to do at their full
capacity.

Authority
Authority within the team is mostly for the scrum master, who was David Drouin, he would ask
all members what they had done and how they had done it, if goals were reached, and what's
to be done for next time. Faisal, Brendan, Andrew, Mark and Yernar are all programmers within
the Scrum agile structure. We all would have stand up meetings, and then discuss what we
have done and how we all did it. Though Brendan was in charge of documentation, he will
check to make sure that documents produced are upto date and of a satisfactory manner. He
checks to make sure everyone has completed there documentation and on time also. The
authority as mentioned before is for the scrum master who is David Drouin, not complete
authority, but authority as in to help us to make sure we do the work, and we know what to do
next.

Communication
The team members communicate through various means. Firstly, we swapped phone numbers
to allow us to call and text each other, this provides each member with the ability to get in
contact with each other (individually) whenever necessary, however, an issue may be that
phone contract or signal issues may hinder our communication methods but for the most
part this should be a consistent and reliable way to get in contact with members of our team.
In terms of a collaborative environment, we will utilize the trac server provided to us on our
PSD3 course to keep a wiki of documents and other items complete with a version control log.
This means we will have a central station to access any documents/files that we each create
together or individually. Tracs one drawback is it is difficult to access outside of the university
server, because of this a GitHub repository has also been set up so the team members can
access and share projects. We will also communicate via Facebook in terms of Chat and
a created group. Here we will be able to have discussions and share information about our
project as it happens. Facebook being a widely utilized website means that we can talk and
brainstorm in a familiar environment without the need to spend time learning a new system.
These online/telecom solutions will provide constant communication. Face-to-Face interaction
will be taken care of with our team meeting on a Wednesday for at least an hour, using more
time if necessary. We expect to increase the meeting time when we begin real implementation
in the second semester and second phase of our team project. Dropbox will be used alongside
trac and GitHub to provide access to recordings and minutes of our meetings plus information
back-up. Mobile apps for Dropbox make it the most portable solution for meeting minutes on the
go and in any situation.
